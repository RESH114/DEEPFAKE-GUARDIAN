# DEEPFAKE-GUARDIAN
Developed a deepfake detection system using deep learning to analyze images (EfficientNet), videos (Xception), and audio (CNN with attention on Mel spectrograms). The model ensures content authenticity and combats misinformation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
This project focuses on developing a robust deepfake detection system to ensure the authenticity of digital content across images, videos, and audio. Leveraging advanced deep learning models, the system identifies tampered media by detecting subtle inconsistencies. EfficientNet is employed for image anomaly detection, XceptionNet processes extracted video frames, and a CNN with attention mechanism analyzes audio via Mel spectrograms. The backend-powered modular architecture ensures efficient media analysis, promoting digital integrity and addressing the rising threat of AI-generated misinformation. Model performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
